Here you can find a symmetrical NACA profiles generator. It provides a defined number of points which describe the shape of the profile. By default, the code generates a NACA0015, but just by changing t parameter, which represents the maximum thickness as a fraction of the chord, it can be achieved any symmetrical NACA profile. The rule is:

       NACA00XX -> t=0.XX

It can also be changed the chord of the profile, as well as the number of points obtained. Afterwards, these points can be used to create a 3D model like the file .STL attached.

Then, you can also find another Matlab code that models flow behavior through a compressive-expansive duct, it shows an approximate plot of the real streamline variation through a nozzle.
