Here you can find a symmetrical NACA profiles generator. It provides a defined number of points which describe the shape of the profile. By default, the code generates a NACA0015, but just by changing t parameter, which represents the maximum thickness as a fraction of the chord, it can be achieved any symmetrical NACA profile. The rule is:

  ``NACA00XX -> t=0.XX``

It can also be changed the chord of the profile, as well as the number of points obtained. Afterwards, these points can be used to create a 3D model like the file .STL attached.
