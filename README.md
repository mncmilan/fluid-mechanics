Here you can find a symmetrical NACA profiles generator. It provides a defined number of points which describe the shape of the profile. By default, the code generates a NACA0015, but just by changing t parameter, which represents the maximum thickness as a fraction of the chord it can be achieved any symmetrical NACA profile. the rule is:

``NACA00XX -> t=0.XX``
